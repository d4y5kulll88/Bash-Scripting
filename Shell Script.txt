What is Shell?
A Shell is a Command-Line Interpreter that provides a user interface for an Operating System's services.
It allows users to interact with the system through commands.

Shell Scripting is powerful way to automate tasks & perform operations in a Unix or Linux Environment.
It involves writing series of commands in a script file that can be executed as a single unit.
Shell Scripts are interpreted, not compiled. The Shell reads & executes the script line by line.


Debugging:
The "set -x" command enables debugging mode, which displays each command before executing it.
